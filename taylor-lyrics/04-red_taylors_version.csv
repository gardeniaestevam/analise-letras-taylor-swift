Red (Taylor’s Version),State of Grace (Taylor’s Version),1,I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights,1
Red (Taylor’s Version),State of Grace (Taylor’s Version),1,Busy streets and busy lives,2
Red (Taylor’s Version),State of Grace (Taylor’s Version),1,And all we know is touch and go,3
Red (Taylor’s Version),State of Grace (Taylor’s Version),1,We are alone with our changing minds,4

Red (Taylor’s Version),State of Grace (Taylor’s Version),1,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes",16

Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold",1
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,2
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,3
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",4
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",5

Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,I remember it all too well,16
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red",17
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,18
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,19
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",20
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And I know it's long gone and,21

Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And I forget about you long enough,23
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,To forget why I needed to,24
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,25
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,26
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Down the stairs, I was there",27
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"I remember it all too well, yeah",28
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And maybe we got lost in translation,29
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Maybe I asked for too much,30
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,31
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Til you tore it all up,32
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Running scared, I was there",33
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,I remember it all too well,34
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,And you call me up again,35
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Just to break me like a promise,36
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,37
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,38
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Cause I remember it all, all, all",39

Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it",42
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,43
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,44
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,45
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,46
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,You can't get rid of it,47
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Cause you remember it all too well, yeah",48
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Cause there we are again when I loved you so,49
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,50
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"It was rare, I was there",51
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,I remember it all too well,52
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"Wind in my hair, you were there",53

Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,You remember it all,56
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,"It was rare, I was there",57
Red (Taylor’s Version),All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),5,I remember it all too well,58
Red (Taylor’s Version),22 (Taylor’s Version),6,It feels like a perfect night,1
Red (Taylor’s Version),22 (Taylor’s Version),6,To dress up like hipsters,2
