Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",1
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",2
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"You were in college working part-time, waiting tables",3
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Left a small town, never looked back",4
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,I was a flight risk with a fear of falling,5
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts,6
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"I say, ""Can you believe it?""",7
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,As we're lying on the couch,8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,The moment I could see it,9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Yes, yes, I can see it now",10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?",11
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You put your arm around me for the first time,12
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,13
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,14
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,15
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,And there's a drawer of my things at your place,16
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,17
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes,18
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,But we got bills to pay,19
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,We got nothing figured out,20
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,When it was hard to take,21
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Yes, yes, this is what I thought about",22
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?",23
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You put your arm around me for the first time,24
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,25
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,26
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?,27
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You saw me start to believe for the first time,28
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,29
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,30
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Oh-oh, oh",31
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM",32
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,As everything was slipping right out of our hands,33
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street,34
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Braced myself for the goodbye,35
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Cause it's all I've ever known,36
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,Then you took me by surprise,37
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone"" (Oh)",38
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water",39
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time",40
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter,41
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine""",42
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Hold on, make it last",43
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Hold on, never turn back",44
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,45
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine,46
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)",47
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)",48
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,"And I can see it (Yeah, yeah)",49
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine (Taylor’s Version),1,I can see it now,50
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm,1
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,And I'm a house of cards,2
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin',3
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,But I kinda know that I won't get far,4
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch",5
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of,6
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain",7
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain",8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down",10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around,11
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,12
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea,13
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,You touch me once and it's really somethin',14
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be,15
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world,16
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"But with you, I know it's no good",17

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,It's just wrong enough to make it feel right,27
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version),2,"And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?",28
